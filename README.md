# ViperShell v0.2

ViperShell is a basic python shell that combines the default shell with new features. Made for use with command prompt. you must have python IDLE 3 installed, even if you wont use the IDLE

new features:
- read program code in interpreter
- execute programs from shell

How to set up:
- copy the ViperShell file from this repository
- make a new file and paste it there 
- change the variable called projectFolder to the path/address of the folder where you keep your files
- search "environment variables" in settings. choose the one that says something like "modify system environment variables. make a new environment variable called PYTHONSTARTUP and hit browse files. choose the ViperShell_0-2.py file.
- Open command prompt and type in 'py' or 'python' (without the quotes) to start the shell

How to use:
ViperShell can do all the things a regular shell can do, and more! use 'read programName.py' to see file code right in the editor, and use 'run programName.py' to execute programs without having to leave the shell. use 'quit' to exit the shell.

note: all your python files must be in the same folder as the ViperShell file
