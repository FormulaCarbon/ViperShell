# ViperShell v0.1

ViperShell is a basic python IDLE shell that combines the default shell with new features. Made for use with Python IDLE 3

new features:
- read program code in interpreter
- execute programs from shell

How to set up:
- copy the ViperShell file from this repository
- make a new file and paste it there 
- change the variable called projectFolder to the path/address of the folder where you keep your files
- launch on startup
- You are ready to go!

How to use:
ViperShell can do all the things a regular shell can do, and more! use 'read programName.py' to see file code right in the editor, and use 'ex programName.py' to execute programs without having to leave the shell. use 'quit' to exit the shell.

note: all your python files must be in the same folder as the ViperShell file
